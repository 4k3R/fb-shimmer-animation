# Facebook Shimmer Animiation [Demo]

This is a random demo of mine. Facebook made an animation library for both [iOS](https://github.com/facebook/Shimmer) and [Android](https://github.com/facebook/shimmer-android) called Shimmer. It's used in their Paper, Home & Slingshot applications.

## How to use this in your project

#### For Android

```
// Gradle dependency on Shimmer for Android
dependencies {
  compile 'com.facebook.shimmer:shimmer:0.1.0@aar'
}
```

#### For iOS

There are two options:

Shimmer is available as Shimmer in Cocoapods.

1. Manually add the files into your Xcode project. Slightly simpler, but updates are also manual.
2. Shimmer requires iOS 6 or later.
